    <h2>This is all about Me </h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Md Khushhal, a dedicated and enthusiastic Computer Science Engineering student with a deep interest
        in technology and problem-solving. Since the beginning of my academic journey, I’ve always been curious about
        how things work behind the scenes—especially in the world of computers, software, and the internet. This
        curiosity has led me to explore programming, web development, and various tools that help create powerful
        digital experiences.

        Currently, I’m focused on becoming a skilled full-stack developer. I’m learning and building projects using
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and gradually moving toward advanced technologies like React, Node.js, and databases. I
        enjoy the entire development process—from designing user interfaces to writing clean, efficient backend code.

        Apart from coding, I believe in continuous growth. I spend time reading, experimenting with new tools, and
        improving my problem-solving abilities. I also have a strong interest in freelancing and real-world projects,
        where I can apply what I’ve learned to create something useful.

        My goal is to build a career where I can contribute to innovative software solutions and work with people who
        share a love for technology and creativity.


    </p>
